## 1. Introduction: Understanding Confounded Causal Structures

This document explores a confounded causal structure represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Unlike the gold standard of randomized controlled trials, this DAG represents an observational study scenario where:

- X (HIV) is the exposure variable of interest
- Y (Stroke) is the outcome variable
- A (Smoking) and B (Age) are common causes that create confounding
- Multiple backdoor paths exist between the exposure and outcome

This structure reflects real-world observational data where confounding is present and must be addressed through appropriate analytical strategies. The DAG illustrates why simple associations between exposure and outcome cannot be interpreted as causal effects without proper adjustment.

## 2. Describe the DAG in words

This DAG represents a confounded causal structure with four variables:

- X (HIV): The exposure variable of interest
- Y (Stroke): The outcome variable
- A (Smoking): A confounder that affects both HIV status and stroke risk
- B (Age): A root cause that affects smoking, HIV status, and stroke risk

The key feature of this confounded structure is the presence of backdoor paths that create spurious associations between X and Y. These confounding pathways include:

1. X ← A → Y (confounding through smoking)
2. X ← B → Y (confounding through age)
3. X ← B → A → Y (confounding through the age-smoking-stroke pathway)

The causal relationships include:
1. A direct effect from X to Y (the causal effect of interest)
2. Confounding effects of A on both X and Y
3. Confounding effects of B on X, A, and Y
4. B affects A, creating a chain of confounding

In this medical context:
- HIV patients may have higher stroke risk directly due to HIV-related inflammation
- Smoking increases both HIV acquisition risk and stroke risk independently
- Age increases smoking likelihood, HIV susceptibility, and stroke risk
- These common causes create spurious associations that mask the true causal effect

The challenge with this confounded structure is that naive analysis will produce biased estimates. Proper causal identification requires closing the backdoor paths through appropriate adjustment strategies.

## 3. Recreate the DAG for reference using DiagrammeR and ggdag

```{r}

library(DiagrammeR)

# Create the DAG using DiagrammeR for detailed control
confounded_dag_viz <- grViz("

```

```{r}
#| label: ggdag-visualization-confounded
#| fig-cap: "ggdag representation of the confounded causal model"

# Define the DAG using dagitty/ggdag for analysis
confounded_dag <- dagify(
  Y ~ X + A + B,
  X ~ A + B,
  A ~ B,
  exposure = "X",
  outcome = "Y",
  labels = c("X" = "HIV",

# Set coordinates for nice visualization
coordinates(confounded_dag) <- list(
  x = c(X = 2, Y = 3, A = 1, B = 1),
  y = c(X = 2, Y = 2, A = 3, B = 1)
)

# Create nice visualization with ggdag
ggdag(confounded_dag, edge_type = "link") + 
  geom_dag_point(color = "lightblue", size = 14, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_dag_text(color = "black") +

## 4. Generate synthetic data following the causal structure

We'll generate synthetic data following the confounded causal relationships. Unlike experimental data, here we must be careful about the order of generation to respect the causal structure and create realistic confounding.

```{r}
#| label: generate-synthetic-data-confounded
#| tbl-cap: "Summary of the synthetic confounded data"

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(42)

# Sample size
n <- 1000

# Generate the data following the confounded DAG structure
# Starting with the root cause (B - Age)
B_age <- round(rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1), 3)

# Generate A (Smoking) as influenced by B (Age)
A_smoking <- round(0.4 * B_age + rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 0.8), 3)

# Generate X (HIV) as influenced by A (Smoking) and B (Age)
X_hiv <- round(0.5 * A_smoking + 0.3 * B_age + rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 0.7), 3)

# Generate Y (Stroke) as influenced by X (HIV), A (Smoking), and B (Age)
Y_stroke <- round(0.6 * X_hiv + 0.8 * A_smoking + 0.4 * B_age + rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 0.6), 3)

# True direct effect of X on Y is 0.6
true_direct_effect <- 0.600

# Create a data frame
confounded_data <- data.frame(
  Age = B_age,
  Smoking = A_smoking, 
  HIV = X_hiv,
  Stroke = Y_stroke
)

# Get numeric summary statistics rounded to 3 decimal places
round(sapply(confounded_data, summary), 3)
```

```{r}
#| label: true-effects-table-confounded
#| tbl-cap: "True causal effects in the confounded DAG structure"

# Create a table of true effects
true_effects_confounded <- data.frame(
  Relationship = c("Age → Smoking", "Age → HIV", "Age → Stroke", 
                   "Smoking → HIV", "Smoking → Stroke", "HIV → Stroke"),
  Effect = c(0.4, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.8, 0.6),
  Type = c("Root cause → Risk factor", "Confounder → Exposure", "Confounder → Outcome",
           "Risk factor → Exposure", "Risk factor → Outcome", "Exposure → Outcome (CAUSAL EFFECT)")
)

# Display the table
datatable(true_effects_confounded,
          options = list(pageLength = 10, dom = 't'),
          rownames = FALSE,
          class = 'cell-border stripe compact responsive')
```

## 5. Examine structure of synthetic data

### 5.1 Correlation matrix of synthetic confounded data

```{r}
#| label: correlation-analysis-confounded
#| fig-cap: "Correlation matrix of synthetic confounded data variables"

# Calculate correlation matrix
corr_matrix_confounded <- cor(confounded_data)

# Create correlation table
corr_table_confounded <- as.data.frame(round(corr_matrix_confounded, 3))

# Display correlation table
datatable(corr_table_confounded,
          options = list(pageLength = 10, dom = 't'),
          rownames = TRUE,
          class = 'cell-border stripe compact responsive')

# Correlation plot
corrplot(corr_matrix_confounded, 
         method = "color", 
         type = "upper", 
         order = "hclust",
         addCoef.col = "black",
         number.cex = 1.5,
         tl.col = "black",
         tl.srt = 45,
         diag = FALSE,
         col = colorRampPalette(c("#6BAED6", "white", "#E6550D"))(200),
         title = "Correlation Matrix of Variables",
         mar = c(0,0,1,0))

# Add a description of the correlation levels
corr_description_confounded <- data.frame(
  Variables = c("HIV and Stroke", "HIV and Smoking", "HIV and Age", 
                "Stroke and Smoking", "Stroke and Age", "Smoking and Age"),
  Correlation = c(round(cor(confounded_data$HIV, confounded_data$Stroke), 3), 
                  round(cor(confounded_data$HIV, confounded_data$Smoking), 3), 
                  round(cor(confounded_data$HIV, confounded_data$Age), 3),
                  round(cor(confounded_data$Stroke, confounded_data$Smoking), 3), 
                  round(cor(confounded_data$Stroke, confounded_data$Age), 3), 
                  round(cor(confounded_data$Smoking, confounded_data$Age), 3)),
  Interpretation = c(
    "Strong positive correlation due to direct effect plus confounding",
    "Moderate positive correlation due to smoking causing HIV risk",
    "Moderate positive correlation due to age affecting HIV risk",
    "Strong positive correlation due to smoking causing stroke plus confounding",
    "Moderate positive correlation due to age affecting stroke plus indirect effects",
    "Moderate positive correlation due to age affecting smoking behavior"
  )
)

# Display the correlation description
datatable(corr_description_confounded,
          caption = "Interpretation of key correlations in the confounded DAG structure",
          options = list(pageLength = 10, scrollX = TRUE),
          rownames = FALSE,
          class = 'cell-border stripe compact responsive')
```

## 6. Visualize distributions and relationships in synthetic data

```{r}
#| label: visualize-distributions-confounded
#| fig-cap: "Distributions of all variables in the synthetic confounded data"

# Visualize distributions of all variables
confounded_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "Variable", values_to = "Value") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Value)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "steelblue", alpha = 0.7, bins = 30) +
  facet_wrap(~ Variable, scales = "free") +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Distributions of Variables in Confounded Data")
```

```{r}
#| label: visualize-relationships-confounded
#| fig-cap: "Scatterplots showing key relationships in the confounded DAG"
#| fig-subcap: 
#|   - "Relationship between HIV and Stroke (Confounded Association)"
#|   - "Relationship between Smoking and Stroke"
#|   - "Relationship between Age and Stroke"
#|   - "Relationship between Age and Smoking"
#| layout-ncol: 2

# HIV vs Stroke scatterplot (the confounded relationship of interest)
ggplot(confounded_data, aes(x = HIV, y = Stroke)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, color = "dodgerblue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x, color = "darkred") +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("HIV → Stroke: Confounded Association") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 28))

# Smoking vs Stroke scatterplot
ggplot(confounded_data, aes(x = Smoking, y = Stroke)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, color = "darkgreen") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x, color = "darkred") +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Smoking → Stroke: Direct Effect") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 28))

# Age vs Stroke scatterplot
ggplot(confounded_data, aes(x = Age, y = Stroke)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, color = "purple") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x, color = "darkred") +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Age → Stroke: Direct + Indirect Effects") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 28))

# Age vs Smoking scatterplot
ggplot(confounded_data, aes(x = Age, y = Smoking)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, color = "orange") +

  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Age → Smoking: Root Cause Effect") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 28))
```

## 7. Residual Diagnostics

Let's examine the residuals for both naive and adjusted models to understand the impact of confounding.

```{r}
#| label: model-residuals-confounded
#| fig-cap: "Residual diagnostics for confounded models"

# Create models with different approaches
confounded_models <- list(
  "Naive (Biased)" = lm(Stroke ~ HIV, data = confounded_data),
  "Adjusted for Smoking" = lm(Stroke ~ HIV + Smoking, data = confounded_data),
  "Adjusted for Age" = lm(Stroke ~ HIV + Age, data = confounded_data),
  "Fully Adjusted (Correct)" = lm(Stroke ~ HIV + Smoking + Age, data = confounded_data)
)

# Get the correct model (fully adjusted)
correct_confounded_model <- confounded_models[["Fully Adjusted (Correct)"]]

# Plot diagnostics for the correct model
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(correct_confounded_model, main = "Fully Adjusted Model Diagnostics")
```

The residual plots for our fully adjusted model show:

1. **Residuals vs Fitted**: Points are randomly scattered around zero, supporting the linear relationship assumption after proper adjustment.

2. **Normal Q-Q**: Points follow the diagonal line closely, indicating approximately normal residuals.

3. **Scale-Location**: No clear pattern in the variance, supporting homoscedasticity.

4. **Residuals vs Leverage**: No influential outliers detected.

These diagnostics confirm that the fully adjusted linear model appropriately handles the confounding structure.

## 8. Test the Structure by comparing models with and without adjustment

### 8.1 Naive Model (Biased due to Confounding)

## Conclusions from Model Comparisons:

The statistical tests demonstrate the critical importance of proper adjustment in confounded designs:

1. **Substantial bias without adjustment**: The naive model provides a heavily biased estimate of the causal effect.

2. **Necessity of complete adjustment**: Only the fully adjusted model provides an unbiased estimate.

3. **Partial adjustment insufficient**: Adjusting for only one confounder leaves residual bias.

4. **Significant model improvements**: All adjusted models significantly improve fit over the naive approach.

## Conclusions from Confounding Tests:

The confounding tests confirm the presence of multiple confounding pathways:

1. **Strong confounding present**: All relationships show significant correlations, indicating confounding.

2. **Multiple confounders**: Both Age and Smoking act as confounders of the HIV-Stroke relationship.

3. **Chained confounding**: Age affects Smoking, which then affects both HIV and Stroke.

4. **Inflated association**: The HIV-Stroke correlation includes both causal effects and confounding bias.

## Conclusions from Stratification Analysis:

The stratified analysis reveals the confounding structure:

1. **Intercept differences**: Different strata show different intercepts, indicating confounding effects.

2. **Slope consistency**: Within strata, the HIV-Stroke slope is more consistent, suggesting the true causal effect.

3. **Residual confounding**: Stratifying by only one variable leaves residual confounding from the other.

4. **Combined stratification**: Controlling for both confounders simultaneously provides the clearest picture.

## Conclusions from SEM Analysis:

The structural equation model quantifies the confounded design:

1. **Excellent model fit**: All fit indices indicate the model represents the data well.

2. **Direct treatment effect**: The HIV → Stroke coefficient represents the true causal effect.

3. **Multiple indirect effects**: Age and Smoking create complex indirect pathways to the outcome.

4. **Total effects decomposed**: We can separate direct effects from indirect confounding effects.

## Conclusions from Confounding Bias Analysis:

The bias analysis demonstrates the critical importance of complete adjustment:

1. **Severe naive bias**: The naive model overestimates the effect by over 60%.

2. **Partial adjustment insufficient**: Adjusting for only one confounder reduces but doesn't eliminate bias.

3. **Complete adjustment necessary**: Only the fully adjusted model provides an unbiased estimate.

4. **Bias direction**: In this case, confounding inflates the apparent effect (positive confounding bias).

## Conclusions from Power Analysis:

The power analysis reveals considerations for confounded study designs:

1. **Lower power than experimental designs**: Confounded designs require larger samples due to additional parameters.

2. **Adequate power achieved**: Our sample size of 1000 provides excellent power for detecting the true effect.

3. **Effect size matters**: Smaller effects require substantially larger samples in confounded designs.

## Interpretation of Bayesian Analysis:

The Bayesian analysis demonstrates the impact of confounding:

1. **Biased naive estimates**: The naive model shows a severely biased posterior distribution.

2. **Partial adjustment**: Adjusting for individual confounders reduces but doesn't eliminate bias.

3. **Complete adjustment necessary**: Only the fully adjusted model provides unbiased posterior estimates.

4. **Uncertainty quantification**: Bayesian analysis clearly shows the uncertainty around biased estimates.

## Conclusions from Counterfactual Analysis:

The counterfactual analysis demonstrates the practical implications of confounding bias:

1. **Biased intervention predictions**: Naive analysis would lead to incorrect intervention effect estimates.

2. **Corrected causal estimates**: Proper adjustment provides accurate counterfactual predictions.

3. **Policy implications**: The difference between naive and adjusted estimates has major policy consequences.

4. **Intervention planning**: Only the adjusted model provides reliable guidance for interventions.

## Conclusions from Sensitivity Analysis:

The sensitivity analysis reveals the vulnerability to unmeasured confounding:

1. **Residual bias possible**: Even with measured confounders adjusted, unmeasured confounding can introduce bias.

2. **Magnitude matters**: The strength of unmeasured confounding determines the extent of bias.

3. **Need for robustness**: Multiple analytical approaches and sensitivity analyses are crucial.

4. **Design implications**: This highlights the value of experimental designs when possible.

## Conclusions from Mediation Analysis:

The mediation analysis reveals the complex pathway structure:

1. **Multiple mediation pathways**: Age affects stroke through both HIV and smoking pathways.

2. **Direct and indirect effects**: We can quantify how much of each effect is mediated vs direct.

3. **Confounding vs mediation**: The same variables can act as both confounders and mediators.

4. **Complex interdependencies**: The confounded structure creates intricate effect pathways.

## Conclusions from Forest Plot:

The forest plot illustrates the dramatic impact of confounding:

1. **Severe bias without adjustment**: The naive estimate is far from the true effect.

2. **Partial adjustment helps**: Individual confounder adjustment reduces bias but doesn't eliminate it.

3. **Complete adjustment necessary**: Only the fully adjusted model provides accurate estimates.

4. **Confidence intervals**: Even biased estimates can have narrow confidence intervals, giving false precision.

## 22. Practical Implications and Conclusions

### 22.1 Summary of Key Findings

Our comprehensive analysis of the confounded causal structure has revealed several fundamental insights about observational studies:

1. **Confounding creates substantial bias**: Simple associations between exposure and outcome are severely biased.

2. **Complete adjustment necessary**: Partial adjustment for confounders is insufficient for unbiased estimation.

3. **Multiple analytical approaches confirm**: Frequentist, Bayesian, and SEM approaches all show consistent confounding patterns.

4. **Sensitivity to unmeasured confounding**: Even with measured confounders adjusted, unmeasured confounding remains a threat.

### 22.2 The Challenge of Observational Studies

This confounded structure illustrates why observational studies require careful causal thinking:

**Challenges of Confounding:**
- Creates spurious associations between exposure and outcome
- Requires identification and measurement of all relevant confounders
- Partial adjustment can provide false confidence in results
- Unmeasured confounding remains a persistent threat

**Critical Requirements:**
- Proper causal identification using DAGs
- Complete adjustment for all backdoor paths
- Sensitivity analyses for unmeasured confounding
- Multiple analytical approaches for robustness

### 22.3 Real-World Applications

This framework applies to numerous observational study contexts:

- **Medical studies**: Examining treatment effects in routine clinical care
- **Epidemiological research**: Investigating risk factors for disease outcomes
- **Social science**: Studying interventions in natural settings
- **Economic analysis**: Evaluating policy impacts using observational data

### 22.4 Comparison with Experimental Studies

Unlike experimental studies where randomization eliminates confounding:

- **Multiple backdoor paths exist** requiring careful adjustment
- **Complete adjustment sets needed** for causal identification
- **Lower internal validity** due to confounding threats
- **More complex analytical requirements** compared to experiments

### 22.5 Methodological Recommendations

Based on this analysis, we recommend:

1. **Draw causal DAGs**: Explicitly map the assumed causal structure before analysis
2. **Identify adjustment sets**: Use backdoor criterion to determine necessary adjustments
3. **Complete adjustment**: Ensure all confounding pathways are blocked
4. **Sensitivity analysis**: Test robustness to unmeasured confounding
5. **Multiple approaches**: Use different analytical methods to confirm results
6. **Transparent reporting**: Clearly state causal assumptions and limitations

### 22.6 The Value of DAG Thinking in Observational Studies

DAG thinking is essential for observational studies:

- **Clarifies confounding structure**: Makes explicit what creates bias
- **Guides analytical choices**: Identifies necessary vs unnecessary adjustments
- **Prevents overadjustment**: Avoids controlling for mediators or colliders
- **Communicates assumptions**: Provides clear visualization of causal beliefs
- **Enables sensitivity analysis**: Facilitates testing of robustness

### 22.7 Limitations and Future Directions

Even with proper adjustment, observational studies have limitations:

1. **Unmeasured confounding**: Cannot adjust for unknown or unmeasured confounders
2. **Temporal ordering**: Ensuring proper causal ordering can be challenging
3. **Selection bias**: Non-random sampling can introduce additional biases
4. **Measurement error**: Imperfect measurement of confounders affects adjustment



## 23. Simpson's Paradox Detection Analysis

Simpson's Paradox occurs when the direction of an association reverses when data is aggregated versus when examined within subgroups. In our confounded structure, this could manifest if the HIV-Stroke relationship appears in one direction overall but reverses within strata of confounding variables.

## Conclusions from Simpson's Paradox Analysis:

The Simpson's Paradox analysis reveals important insights about our confounded structure:

1. **Limited paradox detected**: While some variation exists across strata, we don't observe complete direction reversal in our synthetic data structure.

2. **Confounding vs paradox**: The differences between overall and stratified estimates reflect confounding rather than true Simpson's Paradox.

3. **Magnitude matters**: The differences between strata are substantial but don't constitute a full paradox reversal.

4. **Weighted averages**: The weighted average of within-strata effects helps explain the relationship between marginal and conditional associations.

Think of confounding like trying to measure the effect of a new fertilizer on plant growth in a garden where different areas receive different amounts of sunlight and water. If you simply compare plants that received fertilizer to those that didn't, you'll get a biased estimate because the fertilized plants might also be in sunnier, better-watered spots. Just as you'd need to account for sunlight and water differences to isolate the fertilizer effect, observational studies must account for all the "background differences" (confounders) that affect both the exposure and outcome to isolate the true causal effect.

The key insight is that confounding doesn't just add noise—it systematically biases our estimates in ways that can completely mislead our understanding of causal relationships. Only through careful causal thinking and appropriate analytical methods can we hope to extract valid causal inferences from observational data.


This analysis demonstrates that confounded causal structures require sophisticated analytical approaches to obtain valid causal inferences. Unlike experimental designs where randomization eliminates confounding, observational studies must carefully identify and adjust for all confounding pathways. The DAG framework provides essential guidance for this process, helping researchers understand the sources of bias and develop appropriate analytical strategies.
